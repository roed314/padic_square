A multiset b of items into the ith bin is valid if is_valid(i,b) is true. If b is a partial binning extendable to a valid binning, then is_semivalid(i,b) must be true; this is used to terminate branches of the algorithm early",2,0,1,82,0,148,1,1,82,0,148,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,82,,0,0,82,,82,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
