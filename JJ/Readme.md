The files:

  * myii.m computes indices of inseparability in magma (maybe doesn't work)
  * indices.gp computes indices of inseparability in gp
  * getslopes.m computes slopes for degree 16 fields
  * conf2.m calls getslopes on 10 entries from the list of
      polynomials
  * field-gal-2-3 and field-gal-2-5 contain degree 16 extensions
    of Q unramified outside {2,3} and {2,5} respectively.  Each
    entry is a pair of the polynomial and the T-number of its
    Galois group.
