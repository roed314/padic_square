# Overall project description

We are aiming to understand how various parameterizations of p-adic fields interact with Galois groups, ramification polygons, residual polynomials, indices of inseparability and other invariants.

# Subprojects

## Galois stratification of Monge varieties

Monge's paper on cyclic extensions of degree p^2 works out an example.

## Higher ramification polygons

Looking for more refined invariants to break up the Monge varieites into smaller pieces.

## Counting extensions by Galois group

## Using Montes' algorithm

## Predicting slopes from a Galois group

Given an abstract group G, we would like to understand what possible ramification filtrations are possible, both as bare subgroup chains within the group and with ramification breaks attached.
This may interact with the choice of a permutation representation of the group.

## Partial globalization

Finding number fields that are Galois splitting models for sexdecic 2-adic fields.

## Building computational tools

We want to gather existing computational tools for working with p-adic fields and build new ones.  This involves writing code in Sage, Magma, and GP, as well as adding information to the LMFDB.

## Sexdecic 2-adic fields
