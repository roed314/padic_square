# Overall project description

We are aiming to understand how various parameterizations of p-adic fields interact with Galois groups, ramification polygons, residual polygons, indices of inseparability and other invariants.

# Subprojects

## Galois stratification of Monge varieties

## Counting extensions by Galois group

## Using Montes' algorithm

## Predicting slopes from a Galois group

Given an abstract group G, we would like to understand what possible ramification filtrations are possible, both as bare subgroup chains within the group and with ramification breaks attached.
This may interact with the choice of a permutation representation of the group.

## Building computational tools

We want to gather existing computational tools for working with p-adic fields and build new ones.  This involves writing code in Sage, Magma, and GP, as well as adding information to the LMFDB.

# Starting points

Many of us brought different perspectives to the table

Notes from Kevin's talk on indices of inseparability can be found in the `Presentations` folder, and more details can be found in ....

## Enumerating extensions

Slides from Sebastian's talk on enumerating extensions can be found in the `Presentations` folder, and more details can be found in ....

## Near-canonical polynomials

Slides from David Roberts' talk on Monge's work can be found in the `Presentations` folder, and more details can be found in ....

# Computational tools

## Chris Rowley's p-adic Galois group code

Chris Rowley's code can be found [here](https://github.com/cjdoris/pAdicGaloisGroup).

## Montes package

The handbook and Magma source for Jordi and Enric's Montes implementation can be found in the `Montes` folder.

## Valuation filtrations

Code for finding possible filtrations of an abstract group can be found in `Roe/padic_filtrations.m`.

## Counting Galois groups

Code for counting p-adic fields with a given Galois group can be found in `Roe/padic_galois_counts.m`.
